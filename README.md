# Jum'ah Khutbah
A webapp which provides a well defined set of steps on how one can deliver a Friday Sermon.

This can help a group of friends or coworkers to attend/perform the obligatory Jum'ah prayer hopefully easily by following all the necessary steps provided. This can be practiced/followed in scenarios when there are no mosques nearby or no pre established gathering for the prayer or in case of an unexpected hurdle in the course of attending one.

### Point to Note
**This app in no way encourages for a group of individuals to intentionally create their own small gathering when they can easily attend a nearby location/mosque of a considerably large gathering that has already been established for the Jum'ah prayer.**
